record PurchaseOrder (String item, String category, Integer price){}

// faker has "commerce()" to create this object with random values.

- Let's imagine that we've an order stream though which we keep on getting the purchase orders events like every 200/500 ms.
- We can use commerce faker to fill the purchase order
- Business is interested in only 2 categories: Kids, Automotive

Business Rule:
    - Kids order
        - add 1 free order for every kids order
    - Automotive order
        - add $100 to the price.

Task: Implement above business rule.
